# Manga Store

This is a small React project to practice responsive web design concepts such as flex-box and grid layouts.
Originally this was a static HTML project but I decided to integrate React using React-Router and React-Helmet.

## Development

To start this project in development you need to run the following commands:
```bash
yarn
yarn start
```
